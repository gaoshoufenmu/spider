# demo
1. Linux
```
cd $PPB_ROOT
./experiments/scripts/rank_car.sh
```

2. Windows [deprecated]
```
cd $PPB_ROOT
./experiments/scripts/rank_car_ansi.bat
```
In Windows environment, execute the script with caution because Chinese garbled characters may
arise. That's why I propose the special script 'rank_car_ansi.bat'.

### UPDATE:
Problem of Chinese garbled characters has been worked out now and just try as the `3` step.

3. Windows
```
cd $PPB_ROOT
./experiments/scripts/rank_car.bat
```
